# Coding Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts developed to solve coding challenges proposed by Target Sistemas. Each file addresses a specific task and provides a solution using Python programming.

## Projects
- `1-SOMA-check` : A script that calculates the sum of a sequence of integers from 1 up to a defined index value.
- `2-fibonacci` : A script that checks whether a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence. 
- `3-faturamento-analise` : A script that analyzes daily revenue data from a JSON file. It calculates the lowest and highest revenue values and determines how many days the revenue exceeded the monthly average, considering only positive values.
- `4-faturamento-regional` : A script that calculates the percentage contribution of each state to the total revenue of a distributor.
- `5-inverte-string` : A script that reverses the characters of a string provided by the user without using built-in functions.

## Installation
To run these scripts, you need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script you want to run is located.
3. Execute the script using Python.
